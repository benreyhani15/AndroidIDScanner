# AndroidIDScanner
This is an Android mobile application that scans and extracts information from identification cards. In order to do so, two methods are used: 1) PDF417 Barcode Decoding and 2) Optical Character Recognition (OCR). In the former, an individual's information is extracted by decoding the PDF417 barcode found on the back of the card. However, in the latter mode, the information is extracted by applying OCR to the text found on the front of an individual's ID card.
